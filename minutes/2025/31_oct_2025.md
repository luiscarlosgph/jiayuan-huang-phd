# 2nd Meeting with Dr. Luis

**Date:** 31<sup>st</sup> Oct 2025  
**Time:** 1:10 pm â€“ 2:52 pm

## ðŸ§­ Discussion

1. **Literature Review on Cold Start Active Learning**  
   - Jiayuan presented the literature review for *Cold Start Active Learning*.  
   - Dr. Luis recommended Jiayuan to read more papers on **Uncertainty in Deep Learning**, and to follow **Gal Yarinâ€™s** research progress on uncertainty.

2. **Proposed Research Questions**  
   Dr. Luis proposed three key research directions:
   - **(a)** How to identify the **transition phase** in active learning (the low-to-high uncertainty transition point).  
   - **(b)** Further research on **Self-Supervised Learning Feature Extractors** (e.g., HMSN + Clustering via LP-based Stabilities).  
   - **(c)** Does **Active Learning** perform similarly across different task types â€” such as **Image Classification**, **Semantic Segmentation**, and **Object Detection**?

3. **Study Methodology Advice**  
   - Dr. Luis guided Jiayuan on how to build foundational knowledge in **Computer Vision (CV)**.  
   - Suggested approaches include reading **top-conference papers** and developing a **curious and explorative mindset**.

## âœ… Action Plan

1. **Continue and Expand Literature Review**  
   - Review unfinished papers and the new ones recommended by Dr. Luis:  
     - [Hyperbolic Self-Supervised Learning by Clustering with Ideal Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10926)  
     - [Clustering Paper (NeurIPS 2008)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2008/file/288cc0ff022877bd3df94bc9360b9c5d-Paper.pdf)

2. **Explore Curiosity-Driven Research**  
   - Read about **NeRF** and related work:  
     - [NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934)  
     - [Gaussian splatting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04079)

3. **Follow Gal Yarinâ€™s Research**  
   - Track publications and updates: [Gal Yarin on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SIayDoQAAAAJ) and read more papers regarding Deep Learnign Uncertainty.

4. **Review ICCV Papers**  
   - Read and analyze the papers Dr. Luis identified during **ICCV**.
