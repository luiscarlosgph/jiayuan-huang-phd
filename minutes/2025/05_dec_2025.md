# 6th Meeting with Dr. Luis


**Date:** 24<sup>st</sup> Nov 2025  
**Time:** 18:30 pm – 19:10 pm

## ✅ Action Plan


1. **Finish the Understandign Machine Learning Book**  
   - finish the rest of the book.


2. **Explore Properties in the Hyperbolic Space**  
   - Rectify the experiment, try different t-SNE when perplexity is different (10, 20, 30).
   - Denote the concrete name of each class to see if they are corrctly distributed together.
   - Verify if the fine-grained images has a very small distance in Euclidean space has a larger space in the hyperbolic space? Verify it it comes out of background or some other factors.

3. **Play with the rectangle toy model**
   - Explore if the transition point exists in the toy model.
   - If it exists, given \epsilon and \delta, find the bound of the size of the data.
   - If we make it in the rectangle, try the liniear classifier.
   - Try different classifiers, because there might be a situation that sometimes AL is always better than Randomly Sampling (RS), sometimes there exist one transition point after which the AL is better than RS. Explore when will each case happen, why.
